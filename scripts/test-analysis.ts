  // Sample coaching conversation transcript
  const testTranscript = `
Dr. Success: Welcome to this transformational journey! Today we're going to establish your burning desire and definite purpose. Tell me, what's your biggest dream?

User: I want to start my own business, something in tech. I've always wanted to be my own boss and build something meaningful.

Dr. Success: That's wonderful! But I want you to dig deeper. When you say "own business" - what specifically drives that desire? What would that business actually accomplish?

User: Well, I guess I want financial freedom. I'm tired of living paycheck to paycheck. And I have this idea for an app that could help people manage their finances better.

Dr. Success: Now we're getting somewhere! So you want to create financial security for yourself while helping others achieve the same. That's powerful. Let's make this more specific and emotionally charged. If you had that financial freedom, what would that enable in your life?

User: I could finally travel with my family without worrying about money. My kids could go to better schools. I wouldn't have to stress about every bill that comes in.

Dr. Success: Beautiful! Feel that emotion - that's not just wanting, that's burning desire. Now, let's craft this into a definite purpose statement. I want you to write this down: "I will create a successful financial app business that generates $500,000 annually within 18 months, enabling me to provide financial security for my family and help others achieve the same freedom."

User: Wow, that feels powerful when I say it like that. But is it realistic?

Dr. Success: That doubt you just expressed - that's exactly what we need to address. This is the difference between wishing and burning desire. A wish says "wouldn't it be nice if..." but burning desire says "I will find a way or make one." Let's work on transforming that doubt into unshakeable belief.

User: Okay, I can feel the difference. When I think about my kids' future, that doubt melts away. I WILL make this happen.

Dr. Success: Perfect! Now you're experiencing true burning desire. Let's establish your daily visualization practice to program this into your subconscious mind...
