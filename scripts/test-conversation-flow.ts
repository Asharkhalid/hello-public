const TEST_TRANSCRIPT = `Dr. Success: Welcome! I'm Dr. Success, and I'm absolutely thrilled to be your guide on this extraordinary journey through Napoleon Hill's timeless principles. You know, when I first discovered Think and Grow Rich over thirty years ago, I had no idea it would completely transform not just my understanding of success, but my entire life.

Participant: Thank you, Dr. Success. I'm really excited to be here. I've read Think and Grow Rich before, but I feel like I never really applied it properly.

Dr. Success: That's perfectly fine! Reading and applying are two very different things. Today, we're going to dive deep into the foundation of all achievement - the power of burning desire and definite purpose. Let me tell you the most important thing you'll ever learn about success - everything that exists was first a thought in someone's mind.

Participant: That's interesting. I've heard that before but never really thought about it deeply.

Dr. Success: Your current life is the physical manifestation of your dominant thoughts up to this point. If you want to change your life, you must first change your thinking. Napoleon Hill spent 25 years studying the most successful people of his time, and he discovered that they all understood this fundamental truth.

Participant: So you're saying my current situation is because of how I've been thinking?

Dr. Success: Exactly! Here's the thing - most people think about what they don't want, and then wonder why they keep getting it. Now, let me ask you something - how many people do you know who say they want to be successful, but they're not willing to do what success requires?

Participant: Actually, quite a few. I guess I might be one of them sometimes.

Dr. Success: You see, that's the difference between wishing and desire. Wishing is passive. It's hoping something good will happen to you. But burning desire? That's active. That's when you become willing to do whatever it takes.

Participant: I think I understand the concept, but I'm not sure if I have that burning desire. How do I know if what I want is really a burning desire?

Dr. Success: Great question! The desire that makes you feel excited and scared at the same time - that's probably your real burning desire. I want you to close your eyes for a moment and ask yourself - if you could achieve anything in the next five years, what would it be?

Participant: Well, I'd love to start my own business and become financially independent. I want to be able to provide for my family without worrying about money.

Dr. Success: That's a good start, but let me dig deeper. What are you willing to give up to get it? Because every burning desire requires sacrifice.

Participant: I... I'm not sure. I mean, I'd work hard, but I haven't really thought about what I'd sacrifice.

Dr. Success: That's honest, and honesty is where real transformation begins. Don't just tell me you want financial freedom. Tell me why. What would financial freedom give you that you don't have now?`;
