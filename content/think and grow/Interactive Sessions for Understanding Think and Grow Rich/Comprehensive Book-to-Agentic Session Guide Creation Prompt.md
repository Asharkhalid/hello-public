# Comprehensive Book-to-Agentic Session Guide Creation Prompt

## Overview
This prompt will guide you through researching any practical non-fiction book and converting it into a comprehensive set of agentic session guides in JSON format. Each session will be designed for AI-powered conversational learning experiences.

## Research Phase

### 1. Multi-Source Research Strategy

**Primary Book Analysis:**
- Read comprehensive book summaries from multiple sources
- Identify the core principles, concepts, and actionable strategies
- Extract key exercises, case studies, and practical applications
- Note the book's structure, chapter organization, and progression

**YouTube Research (Critical Component):**
Search for these specific types of content:
- "[Book Title] summary" - Look for 10-30 minute comprehensive summaries
- "[Author Name] interview" - Author interviews discussing key concepts
- "[Book Title] animated summary" - Visual summaries that highlight key points
- "[Book Title] book review" - Critical analysis and practical applications
- "[Author Name] keynote" or "[Author Name] speech" - Author presentations
- "[Book Title] implementation" - Videos showing real-world application

**Recommended YouTube Channels for Book Summaries:**
- Productivity Game
- The Art of Improvement
- FightMediocrity
- Blinkist (if available)
- Book Summary channels in your target language

**Additional Research Sources:**
- Author's official website and blog posts
- Podcast interviews with the author
- Academic papers or studies referenced in the book
- Goodreads reviews focusing on practical application
- LinkedIn articles by people who implemented the concepts
- Reddit discussions in relevant communities
- Course materials or workshops based on the book

### 2. Content Analysis Framework

**Principle Extraction:**
- Identify 6-12 core principles or concepts from the book
- Determine the logical progression and dependencies between concepts
- Extract specific, actionable strategies for each principle
- Identify common obstacles and how to overcome them

**Practical Application Focus:**
- Find real-world examples and case studies
- Identify exercises and activities that reinforce learning
- Extract measurable outcomes and success criteria
- Note implementation challenges and solutions

**Audience Adaptation:**
- Consider different industries and contexts where principles apply
- Identify how concepts need to be adapted for different audiences
- Extract universal principles vs. context-specific applications

## Session Design Phase

### 3. Program Structure Creation

**Session Planning:**
- Create 6-10 sessions (optimal is 8 sessions)
- Each session should cover 1-2 major principles
- Ensure logical progression from foundational to advanced concepts

- Include review and integration elements

**Session Distribution Guidelines:**
- Sessions 1-2: Foundation and mindset
- Sessions 3-5: Core principles and strategies
- Sessions 6-7: Advanced applications and integration
- Session 8: Mastery, obstacles, and next steps
